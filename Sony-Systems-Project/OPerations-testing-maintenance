Prerequisite:
Docker engine installed, Docker hub account , Kubernetes infrastructure


Operation commands

docker build -f Dockerfile -t myimage .   #to build the docker image of the application

docker images                                ##to list all the images already built

docker run -p 8010:5000 <IMAGE ID>          ##to start and run the container with the image Id

http://localhost:8010                       ##to access the image locally




## To push to docker hub

docker tag myimage:latest olisaemeka111/sn-systems-project:latest
docker push olisaemeka111/sn-systems-project:latest


 ##To pull the image for deployment to Kubernetes

 docker pull olisaemeka111/sn-systems-project:latest.


 ## Maintenance
 To update the service, modify the code and rebuild the Docker image using the commands above.
 Run the update script periodically to update the dependencies or set up an automated cronjob.

 chmod +x update_dependencies.sh
 ./update_dependencies.sh

 To maintain optimal performance of the Flask application, periodic maintenance should include monitoring, updating, and optimizing various aspects of the application and its environment. Here's a detailed breakdown of the maintenance processes:

 1. Performance Monitoring post deployment
 Logs Management: Regularly monitor the application logs to identify any potential issues or performance bottlenecks. Implement log rotation to prevent logs from consuming too much disk space.
 Metrics Collection: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana to collect metrics such as response time, request rates, and error rates. This helps in identifying performance degradation over time.
 Health Checks: Implement health checks for the application to ensure it’s running smoothly. This can include checking the response time and ensuring the application is responding to requests properly.

 2. Security Updates
 Library Updates: Regularly update the Python libraries and dependencies used in your application, including Flask and hashlib, to ensure you are protected against known vulnerabilities.
 Security Patches: Keep the operating system and Docker environment updated with the latest security patches.
 SSL/TLS Certificates: Although not initially required, if you add HTTPS support, ensure SSL/TLS certificates are kept up-to-date and renewed as needed.

 3. Resource Optimization
 Memory and CPU Usage: Monitor and optimize the memory and CPU usage of the application. If the application is resource-intensive, consider optimizing the code, such as by using more efficient algorithms or by offloading tasks to background workers.
 File Size Limits: Implement file size restrictions to avoid processing overly large files, which could lead to performance degradation. Adjust these limits based on your server’s capacity.
 Docker Container Optimization: Regularly rebuild and update the Docker image to ensure it uses the latest dependencies and is optimized for performance. Remove any unnecessary files from the image to reduce its size.

 4. Scaling and Load Management
 Auto-scaling: Implement auto-scaling policies if the application is deployed in a production environment to handle increased traffic.
 Load Balancing: If the application is scaled across multiple instances, implement load balancing to distribute the traffic evenly.
 Caching: Introduce caching mechanisms for frequently requested files or results to reduce load on the server.

 5. Backup and Disaster Recovery
 Regular Backups: Even though files don’t need to be stored long-term, if you decide to keep temporary backups, ensure they are periodically cleared to save space and that there’s a disaster recovery plan in place.
 Disaster Recovery Plan: Develop a disaster recovery plan to restore the service quickly in case of a failure, including automated container recovery and backup restoration.

 6. Database Maintenance (if applicable)
 Database Optimization: If you decide to store any data related to the files or users, ensure the database is regularly optimized, with indexes maintained and queries optimized.
 Regular Backups: Ensure regular backups of the database, and test the restore process periodically.

 7. Application Updates
 Feature Enhancements: Regularly update the application with new features or improvements based on user feedback and performance data.
 Testing: Before deploying updates, conduct thorough testing in a staging environment to prevent any disruptions to the service.

 8. Documentation
 Update Documentation: Ensure that all documentation, including deployment, maintenance, and operational procedures, is kept up-to-date with any changes made to the application or infrastructure.
 Knowledge Sharing: Regularly review and share knowledge with your team about the application’s performance, updates, and any issues encountered.
 By following these maintenance processes, you can ensure that your Flask application remains performant, secure, and reliable over time.
