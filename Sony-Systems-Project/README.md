# Sony-Systems-Project
SN system project 1
Project Overview

Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Python (for simplicity and ease of use).
Web Framework: Flask (lightweight and easy to set up for small web services).
Containerization: Docker (to ensure that the service is portable and can run on any platform).
MD5 Hashing: Pythonâ€™s hashlib library.
Implementation Steps:
Step 1: Set up Flask Application:
Create a basic Flask web server that handles file uploads via an HTML form.
On receiving a file, the server will calculate its MD5 hash using hashlib.md5() and return the hash to the user.
Step 2: Dockerize the Application:
Write a Dockerfile to containerize the Flask application.
The Dockerfile will use a Python base image, copy the application code into the container, install dependencies, and start the Flask server.
Step 3: Documentation:
Create a README.md file that explains how to build, run, and interact with the service.
Write additional technical documentation detailing the code, deployment, and maintenance instructions.
Process Methodology:
Development:
Use an iterative approach, starting with a basic Flask server and gradually adding functionality.
Testing:
Test the service locally using Docker to ensure it functions as expected.
Deployment:
Provide instructions on deploying the Docker container on any Linux or Windows system.
Documentation:
Include clear and concise instructions for setup, usage, and maintenance in the README.md.
