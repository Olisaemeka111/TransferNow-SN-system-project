1. Code Explanation:

The Flask application listens for file uploads and processes them by calculating their MD5 hash.
The MD5 hashing is performed using Python's hashlib library.
The Dockerfile defines the environment in which the Flask application runs.


2. Deployment Instructions:

Instructions for building and running the Docker container are provided in the README.md.
Emphasis is placed on ease of deployment using Docker, ensuring platform independence.


3. Maintenance Instructions:

Instructions for updating the code and redeploying the service are included.
Suggestions for logging, monitoring, and scaling in production environments can be added.


Additional Considerations:


Security: Although security is not a requirement, in a real-world scenario, HTTPS should be implemented to secure file uploads.


Scalability: In a production environment, the service could be scaled horizontally using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
